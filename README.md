Solar EV Optimal-Speed Simulator (ML Dataset Generator)

This project models the energy behaviour of a solar-electric vehicle and computes the speed that maximizes remaining state-of-charge (SOC) over a fixed distance. It incorporates drag, rolling resistance, gradient effects, motor efficiency, and solar irradiance.

The script also generates a structured dataset with environmental inputs, vehicle parameters, optimal speed targets, and SOC outcomes, suitable for machine learning and performance analysis.
